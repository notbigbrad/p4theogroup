## Tasks

# solve problem analytically using given assumptions

# solve again numerically

# plot the analytic results and numerical results separately

# quantify the accuracy of the numerical method as the absolute difference between the exact analytical value and the approximate numerical solution

# study how the precision of numerical method increases as you decrease step size / space or time.

# Quantify how the difference in results between two consective steps, the cpu consumption and the computation time varies with desired precision

# solve the more complicated system where there is no analytical solution

# quantify the step difference, cpu consumption, time per itteration

# EXTENDING THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SIMULATION
